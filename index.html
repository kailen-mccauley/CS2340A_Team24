                    <h2>Challenges & Reflections</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Sprint 1</summary>
                        <p>While our objective in connecting our application to Firebase was completed in due time, there was a tremendous effort to collaborate towards the end of the deadline. It took a great amount of communication from all of us. To start, our initial analysis of the tasks weighed on their even distribution among all members. However, later on we realized the firebase portion was a much heavier task than originally anticipated and should have required more attention from the get-go. We then knew we shouldâ€™ve done a better job at spacing out our tasks since firebase ended up requiring more debugging than anything else. Better consideration of that from the start could've led to a more proper allocation of members to that task.<br>
                        <br>Our reasoning for the task division ended up being wrong for a majority of what weâ€™d decided: firebase, views, and navigation bar. Going forward, we needed to evaluate what tasks are dependent on each other since XML, Views, ViewModel, Firebase needed to be completed in that order with prioritization of tasks in the reverse. We noted that our lack of consideration to these tasks had a negative effect on the efficiency of our group project. Regardless, our deliverables turned out extremely good and we had time for additional features where we had our users in mind, for example, the buttons on the navigation bar had names to make navigating the application easier. Username and password had icons to correspond to the given fields and login errors were specific to what the user submitted incorrectly.<br>
                        <br>Maintaining our original schedule with adequate time was not done in the way weâ€™d anticipated. It was a huge challenge to distribute our project throughout the sprint as testing issues delayed completion and some tasks needed to have more individual testing prior to pushing to main. There were issues with .gitignore, the login pages, unit tests assertion issues, and a general understanding among members of project demands. Many mistakes could have been avoided if we analyzed the order of our completions.<br>
                        <br>We worked well when pull requests were being submitted and why. The team made a great effort to communicate and make sure we came up with solutions together when issues occurred. Kailen and Cesar did amazing individual work and went above and beyond to complete the more difficult and tedious portions of the project.<br>
                        <br>Moving forward, we're to ensure success in critical portions of the project: task distribution, a strict schedule of individual tasks deadlines decided prior to implementing any code, analysis of task difficulty, and resource allocation. Our group dynamics were still collaborative and any decisions made were supported by all group members with little to no conflict between each other. Overall, weâ€™ll need to initiate more communication for the success of the project.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Sprint 2</summary>
                        <p>Here, our objective was on the creation of a personal information screen with editable text boxes, a connection between our user and meal databases, and data visualizations to represent user data. Our results were that and much more. For programming, we had ample time to reflect and improve on the tasks weâ€™d completed (UI/UX, aesthetics, data visualization additions, improvement of backend code). Looking at our pre-sprint agreement, we did a phenomenal job correctly analyzing each taskâ€™s required members, something we'd originally struggled with. One small deviation was the separation of 2 people on diagrams/unit tests, we saw it wouldnâ€™t be ideal to have 2 people working on those tasks for 2 weeks. That alleviated the weight of tasks on Firebase members.<br>
                        <br>Truthfully, our team came together extremely well this sprint. Our tasks were done well before the deadline and we had sufficient time to address debugging issues. All to say we did experience slight programming delays since most of our code is sequential. For example, the userâ€™s daily goal on the input meal screen needed the calculation of the userâ€™s caloric goal. In the same way, data visualization had to wait on the retrieval of user data for the input meal screen. That would leave us waiting on 1 member to finish their part before anyone else could move further. On another note, the domain model/SD/SSD/unit tests had issues with 1 member taking up to 4-5 days on their completion. It became a huge point of stress and conflict in the group.<br>
                        <br>Moving forward, in the programming portion, each member needs to be allocated a day or two, depending on our sprint schedule deadline, where they complete their part so other members aren't left in crunch time. However, for the lack of communication from that one group member that dragged completion of the project, we were unsure how to move forward with their lack of accountability on that huge delay. We thought it best to reach out to the professor and our group TA. That said, communication for pull requests for the rest of the group was amazing. We split into pairs of 2 where each member has one other member to check their work and approve their requests. I will say, two members showed their outstanding performance once again. Kailen has stood out for the majority of the project. He sends daily reminders on pending tasks, identifying errors in group code, performing manual checkstyle, improving existing code, adjusting syntax, and debugging where needed. Cesar has shown great contribution, too. He always takes extra time to work on the Firebase, arguably the hardest portion of the project, and goes out of his way to teach others the ins-and-outs of the Firebase implementation.<br>
                        <br>Some actionable steps for Sprint 3: stricter time allocation for each membersâ€™ part and most definitely creating mini-deadlines for sections of the project. Weâ€™ll also need to meet to emphasize the completion of tasks to specific group members who lack the discipline to get their work done relative to the rest of the group. Again, to ensure that weâ€™re not rushing in the final stretch and to learn to manage our time better. Many members have stepped up this time around, and our personal goal is to achieve the same level of enthusiasm that Kailen and Cesar have amongst all members.<br>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Sprint 3</summary>
                        <p>Our goal for Sprint 3 focused on developing the relationship between the pantry/cookbook databases, along with enhancing features on the recipe and recipe detail screens. Additionally, the strategy pattern was integrated into the codebase for flexibility, decoupling, and encapsulation. Our outcome was the teamâ€™s successful implementation of that specified goal, ensuring that databases were pre-populated with entries and functionalities where the ingredient additions and removals from the pantry were smoothly executed. Visual elements were enhanced, aligning with the team's prioritization of a user-friendly application.<br>
                        <br>One main struggle was on the effective utilization of the strategy pattern in our implementation to fulfill the designated requirements. Our challenges were particularly in managing the complexity of the recipe screen's interaction with the cookbook database. Through hard work and trust, our team adapted well and delivered our best effort. We went through a 4-5 day period where one strong obstacle delayed the projectâ€™s progress. It took all of us working on attempting to solve the problem with avoiding logic in the ViewModels and adjusting our code to satisfy those requirements. We went through the process of making new classes, attempting to implement them in the View, approaching that development from different angles all while failing at every turn. It has strengthened our groupâ€™s appreciation for our Firebase members and has had us leaning into expanding the Firebase knowledge amongst more members. We each have a deeper understanding of our projectâ€™s connection to Firebase now after solving it.<br>
                        <br>Team cohesion has improved, with members collaborating more this sprint than shown in the past. Communication channels were maximized to address our greatest issues and ensure smooth progress. There were instances of individual task delays where members parts werenâ€™t done adequately and had to be redone. Itâ€™s noted that half of us donâ€™t know about the significance of some of the code in our project and this lack of comprehension shows in the attempts to use strategy pattern. Sticking to our deadlines has also proven to require more discipline from all of us. We hadn't adhered to the deadlines weâ€™d set in our pre-sprint agreement and it definitely came back to bite us.<br>
                        <br>To enhance future sprints, the team plans to implement stricter time allocation measures, including daily check-ins and clearer task delineation. An emphasis will be placed on continuous improvement of the user interface and communication between the databases to align with evolving user preferences. Perhaps leaning into the resources given to us such as the teaching assistants, office hours, the professor, and Ed discussion can help set us up for success better. We believe our individualistic mindset on the completion of the project can actually hurt us in the long run.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Sprint 4</summary>
                        <p>During Sprint 4, our primary objective was to implement a functional shopping list screen/database that integrates seamlessly with the previously implemented recipe and pantry screens/databases. Additionally, we aimed to add functionality to convert desired recipes into actual meals, updating the calorie tracker implemented in earlier sprints.<br>
                        <br>As per the requirements, we ensured compliance with two design patterns throughout the implementation process. These patterns were carefully integrated into the design to enhance the maintainability of the application. Our team used the decorator pattern in a new screen in an attempt to fulfill the requirements. Our primary objective was to complete the shopping list database. However, we faced challenges as the team members responsible for this aspect failed to adhere to the sprint requirements and hindered the usability of their code. Unfortunately, it resulted in deviations from the pre-sprint agreement, primarily due to the issues with the shopping list database implementation. This impacted the overall progress of the sprint and required additional effort to resolve.<br>
                        <br>Our successful creation of the shopping list screen allows users to view and manage their shopping list items efficiently. Integration with the recipe and pantry screens ensures seamless navigation and data synchronization across different functionalities of the application. In addition to the shopping list screen, we made necessary modifications to the recipe screen to support the new functionality of converting desired recipes into actual meals. Users can now select recipes and initiate the conversion process, which automatically updates the calorie tracker with the nutritional information of the consumed meal.<br>
                        <br>Despite the challenges, our team demonstrated resilience in addressing the issues. Special recognition goes to Kailen for his exceptional dedication in debugging existing code and ensuring alignment with sprint requirements. Reflecting on Sprint 4, we evaluated the team dynamics, collaboration, and encountered multiple challenges. We identified areas of success and opportunities for improvement in teamwork, communication, and individual contributions. This is especially those of problematic team members in prior sprints. Overall a majority of the team had effective communication, and collaboration remained strong throughout the sprint.<br>
                        <br>Moving forward, we aim to enhance our planning processes to minimize error in the initial planning stage and execution of tasks, particularly in ensuring a clear understanding of requirements and distributing responsibilities effectively. To enhance team performance in future sprints, we propose the design of a more comprehensive review process for task analysis and allocating sufficient time for troubleshooting and debugging.<br>
                        <br>To conclude, Sprint 4 presented its share of challenges, but through teamwork and dedication, we were able to overcome them and make significant progress towards our project goals. By reflecting on our experiences and implementing actionable steps for improvement, we are confident in our ability to tackle future executions with greater efficiency and success.</p>
